# Outline:

- An emulation of the all the time classic snake game using PyGame, Tkinter and SQL. PyGame provided the operational basis for the game itself while Tkinter was used to create a GUI to interact with the game and finally SQL was used to house the scores in order to allow for a leaderboard. A detailed description lies below.

# Purpose:

- I had wanted to teach myself PyGame for quite some time but I couldn't find any project that was engaging and challenging at the same time until I finally realised, I could build the classic snake game I had spent most of my childhood whiling away time on. The build would help expose me to the broader more general features of PyGame like how to create a gameloop and PyGame's rect and text features while also allowing me to dig deeper while handling some more logical challenges of the game like detecting collisions, the idea of a growing snake and an increasingly difficult game as the snake grew. I could also brush up on my Tkinter, as I used it's simplicity in my program to add some usability via a leaderboard and start menu. Finally I used SQL to run the metaphorical 'back-end' of the project and used it to store user data and the leaderboard.

# Description:

- UPDATE: I have since added different difficulties to the game and a poison block that when you eat, you die. The number of such blocks increase at a different rate for each difficulty.
- The program itself at its base is rather simple and cleanly written (or atleast that is what I attempted) bearing in mind OOP.
- The constructor of the class handles the set-up of the Tkinter window and tabs while the play_game function houses the PyGame initialisation and the game loop as shown below.

    ```python
    def play_game(self):
          # initialises the pygame window and then sets up and then plays the game
          pygame.init()
          pygame.display.set_caption("Snake")
          self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()
          self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode(self.win_dimensions)

          self.snake_positions = [(200, 180)]
          self.set_new_food_positions()
          while True:
              for event in pygame.event.get():
                  if event.type == pygame.QUIT:
                      pygame.quit()
                  elif event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:
                      self.on_key_press(event)
              self.screen.fill(self.bg_colour)
              self.draw_grid()
              self.draw_obj()
              font = pygame.font.Font(None, 26)
              score_text = font.render('SCORE: {:02}'.format(self.score), True, self.text_colour)
              mode_text = font.render('MODE: {}'.format(self.diff.upper()), True, self.text_colour)
              user_text = font.render("NAME: {}".format(self.user_name), True, self.text_colour)
              self.screen.blit(user_text, (10, 10))
              self.screen.blit(mode_text, (150, 10))
              self.screen.blit(score_text, (300, 10))

              pygame.display.update()

              if self.current_direction:
                  self.move_snake()

              if self.check_collisions(self.snake_positions):
                  pygame.quit()
                  self.update_leaderboard()
                  self.pop_up()

              if self.check_food_collision():
                  self.set_new_food_positions()
                  self.score += 1
                  if not self.easy_game:  # for hard game there is a poison block that changes every time you eat.
                      if self.score > 4 and self.score % 5 == 0:
                          self.set_poison_position()
                  else:
                      if self.score > 7 and self.score % 8 == 0:
                          self.set_poison_position()
                  if self.delay > 0.01:
                      self.delay -= self.delay_reduction
                  else:
                      self.delay = 0.01

              self.clock.tick(30)
    ```

- I chose to restrict all the pygame set up and loop to this sole function as it meant I could give the users to play again and that users would not be met with multiple windows on start up.
- Most of the other functions are descriptively named and are adorned with comments in order to aid readability.
- One interesting thing to note is the use of a namedTuple to initialise various rgb values used throughout the code and I have the Techlado blog to thank for that and a number of nuances in this build as I used their material for reference throughout my scripting.
